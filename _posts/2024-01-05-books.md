Last year, I read:

1. Andy Greenberg - _This Machine Kills Secrets_ (audio)
1. Kyle Chayka - _The Longing for Less_
1. Aubrey Gordon - _You Just Need to Lose Weight_ (audio)
1. Don DeLillo - _Pafko at the Wall_
1. Walter √Ålvarez - _T-Rex and the Crater of Doom_ (audio)
1. Andy Greenberg - _Tracers in the Dark_ (audio)
1. Evan Drellich - _Winning Fixes Everything_ (audio)
1. Kirsten Grind - _The Lost Bank_ (audio)
1. Melissa Febos - _Whip Smart_
1. Prince Harry - _Spare_ (audio)
1. Emily St. John Mandel - _The Glass Hotel_ 
1. Natalie Zina Walschots - _Hench_
1. Ann Leckie - _The Raven Tower_
1. Emily St. John Mandel - _Sea of Tranquility_
1. Ashley Audrain - _The Whispers_
1. Ann Leckie - _Provenance_
1. Martha Schabas - _Various Positions_
1. Jenny Odell - _Saving Time_ (audio)
1. Olga Tokarczuk - _Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead_
1. Carl Erik Fisher - _The Urge: Our History of Addiction_ (audio)
1. N.K. Jemisin - _The Fifth Season_
1. N.K. Jemisin - _The Obelisk Gate_
1. N.K. Jemisin - _The Stone Sky_
1. Ann Leckie - _Translation State_
1. Ashley Audrain - _The Push_
1. Lisa Jewell - _The Family Upstairs_
1. Jon Krakauer - _Under the Banner of Heaven_ (audio)
1. Zoe Whittall - _The Fake_
1. Ottessa Moshfegh - _My Year of Rest and Relaxation_
1. Antony Loewenstein - _The Palestine Laboratory: How Israel Exports the Technology of Occupation Around the World_
1. Elena Ferrante - _My Brilliant Friend_

I'd absolutely recommend most of them. I really enjoyed _The Glass Hotel_ and _Sea of Tranquility_ (to be read in that order), and _The Whispers_ grabbed my attention so well that I almost finished it in a day. _Under the Banner of Heaven_ makes a great audiobook, like an incredibly long investigative podcast. The Broken Earth trilogy is as great as the hype says it is. And if you like dinosaurs and history, it's hard to top a book by one of the people who proposed the impact theory in the first place.
