Let's revisit [something I wrote](/2017/06/14/a-fresh-start/) in June 2017:

> First blog posts are awkward. I've written a lot of them only to abandon the blog a year or two later, so I'll dispense with the formality. Hello.

Awkward.

Anyway, the internet sucks a lot more than it did six years ago, but this site still exists, and I'm glad it does. All of my "content creation" between the last post here and this one was on Twitter. I'm on Mastodon now, which feels comfortably like Old Internet and Twitter combined (this is a good thing), and that has led to ... this. 

(This post is WIP I'm testing the blog build pipeline)
