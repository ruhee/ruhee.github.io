Let's revisit [something I wrote](/2017/06/14/a-fresh-start/) in June 2017:

> First blog posts are awkward. I've written a lot of them only to abandon the blog a year or two later, so I'll dispense with the formality. Hello.

Awkward.

Anyway, the internet sucks a lot more than it did six years ago, but this site still exists, and I'm glad it does. All of my "content creation" between the last post here and this one was on Twitter. I'm on [Mastodon](https://phire.place/@ruhee) now, which feels comfortably like Old Internet and Twitter combined (this is a good thing), and that has led to ... this. 

The life updates: I work at a different software company now, I haven't written frontend code in multiple years (!!?!), and I have _no_ idea if this Jekyll blog is going to build locally anymore. There is a pandemic. I've played very few shows in 3.5 years. I'm a knitter now, and a homeowner. Six years is a while.

I don't really know what I want a blog to _be_ anymore, but it feels silly to decide all of that in advance. For now, here are some things I recently read and enjoyed:

- [_The Fake_, by Zoe Whittall](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566668/the-fake-by-zoe-whittall/)
- [The 'Enshittification' of TikTok, by Cory Doctorow](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/)
- [This Ask Polly column that completely eviscerated me](https://www.ask-polly.com/p/you-think-youre-not-that-ambitious)

See you around.
