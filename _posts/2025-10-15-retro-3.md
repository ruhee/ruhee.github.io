This retro was meant to happen on September 28, but [that day](https://www.mlb.com/news/blue-jays-win-2025-al-east-division-title) I ended up being a little busy:

As these things sometimes go, the baseball just kept on happening, and the Jays kept on going, and now I'm writing weeks late before they play game 6 of the ALCS, which is frankly ridiculous. This team lost 88 games last year and they are playing the _Mariners_ in the _ALCS_. Again, ridiculous.

Baseball playoffs are relentless—there are two off days in a seven-game series. Yesterday was one of them, and we managed to clean the apartment, bake a cake, go to the gym and have some friends over, all things that have been happening a lot less since the end of September. I've kind of dropped off the face of the earth this month and have an encyclopedic knowledge of a few different baseball teams now. It's great. Jays in 7.

#### Catching up

If you read  [my last post about the keyboards](/2025/09/14/retro-2/) , one thing you might notice is that on the old one, the layout is the same as a Mac keyboard (bottom row goes `fn`, `ctrl,` `option`, `cmd`) but on the new one it's `ctrl`, then `fn`. This has caused me unending frustration, especially since `fn` doesn't send the expected signal to OSX, so I haven't been able to remap it correctly. All my terminal and Rectangle commands have been annoying as hell. New stuff might solve the old problems and introduce its own new problems; please tack this onto the hamfisted metaphor from the last one.

I've also been having recurring migraines which I would 0% recommend, so there are fewer other things to note - this will be a relatively lean post. I did really enjoy a few shows recently ([Laura Stevenson](https://www.laurastevenson.net/) w/[Oceanator](https://oceanator.surf/), [Ace of Wands](https://www.aceofwandsband.com/) w/[Praises](https://www.handdrawndracula.com/artists/praises/))—I was pretty surprised that Laura Stevenson's crowd was so young! Like, significant early-20s representation, which is not what I'd have guessed.

#### Things I liked recently

- [_Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America_ by Bridget Read.](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/715421/little-bosses-everywhere-by-bridget-read/) For fans of scam stories and _The Dream_, but also of American politics and getting mad at rich people changing the entire course of history (I guess those two things are basically the same). This book was fascinating. I know a lot about MLMs and I didn't know a ton of what was in here, particularly a lot of the Amway details and how intertwined they were with US presidential politics. Highly recommended. (I listened to the audio.)
