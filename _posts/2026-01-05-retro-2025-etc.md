I waffled a lot about what to include in retros, and eventually waffled about writing retros at all, because I'm always re-evaluating how much to share about myself online. Sometimes I lean way into oversharing, as we probably all do, because it feels like a way to be vulnerable and connect with other people. Other times I share very little, especially when I'm considering all the audiences who might be reading: colleagues, acquaintances, family, strangers, friends, weird bluesky scolds, etc. I don't there is a single "right balance" so much as there is always-shifting context, but I think a useful data point is that I always look forward to my friends' most personal posts on my feed and read them first when they appear. This isn't a professional tech blog and will not be anytime in the future, so maybe my answer is obvious and I'm just nervous about it.

I did actually start writing a 2025 recap a couple of weeks ago but it ended up being a weirdly mean-spirited essay and honestly, none of us need that right now. I'm now sick of reading and thinking about recaps, and I don't know that I want to look back on my year in great public detail now that it's very firmly January, but I will settle for a few bullet points for posterity:

- I quit the job that stack ranked us based on GitHub commit numbers and the like. This was the single most impactful decision I made all year. (I also learned about [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).)
- I started a new job where so far nobody has tracked anything stupid.
- [I logged 41 live shows this year](https://github.com/ruhee/show-archive/blob/master/years/2025.md) (I played 5 of them) which is finally back to pre-covid levels for me, #blessed.
- I read 45 books, including the 18-hour audiobook of _A Short History of Nearly Everything_, which I had had on hold since January 2022 and managed to borrow just before Christmas. I was still 800-something in line in the fall, but suddenly the TPL got more than 100 new copies!
- My boyfriend and I lived together for the whole year (he moved in in November 2024), and that was awesome.
- I finally set a new deadlift 1RM PR which I had not done since 2019. Satisfying!
- [I got a new tattoo](https://bsky.app/profile/ruhee.ca/post/3lqj5gesta22b).
- [The Jays went to the World Series](/2025/11/06/fanfare-for-these-uncommon-men/) and I barely slept for a month.

At one of the shows I played this year (at [Refined Fool in Sarnia, ON](https://www.refinedfool.com/)), we got some really cool photos of us thanks to Jono of [Remedy Collective](https://www.instagram.com/remedyxcollective/). Here's one of me and my "constantly multitasking" musical vibe.

(Join a band, you get an endless stream of cool photos of yourself and your friends!)

A bunch of stuff was less good, like my constantly recurring migraines, my alarming loss of mobility (working on it), [brain bees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety), aimless lack of progress at work and the gym, the list goes on. It wasn't an _easy_ year. But I think the big positive changes—again, the job especially—made it a _good_ year in the end, and a year is so long that it's difficult to describe the whole thing with a single word anyway.

### Things I liked recently 

- [This absolutely deranged 45x45 Connections game](https://thomaswc.com/2025.html) that consumed many hours of my life.
- [This essay by Karly Hartzman of Wednesday](https://www.vulture.com/article/wednesday-karly-hartzman-essay-mj-lenderman-bleeds.html), about breaking up with MJ Lenderman mid-tour and then having to record a love song about him, woof.
- [This hat I made](https://bsky.app/profile/ruhee.ca/post/3mbmjqih5fc24).
- [This Jenny Odell series of conversations with writers and artists about the role of athletics in their lives.](https://www.thebeliever.net/no-one-gave-it-to-you/) I obviously especially loved the one with R.O. Kwon about lifting weights, duh. "I feel like lifting reminds you that you have a body, but also that there are other parts of yourself that aren’t up for judgment right now." Yes!
