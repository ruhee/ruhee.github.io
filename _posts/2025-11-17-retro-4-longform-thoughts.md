After a brief [interlude](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2025.shtml) we're back on the retro train over here! It's almost annual reflection season, which I'm sure will figure prominently in future retros, but for now I'm hoping to just build a habit again. Thanks for being here to read these.

Here's some stuff that has happened in the past few weeks.

#### The burnout didn't magically go away
I actually had a nice few months! I had almost five weeks off after leaving my last job, and now I'm coming up on three months at the new gig. This job came with much less pressure and none of the other stressors. However, now I'm moving from "onboarding and bug tickets" into real meaty work like scoping bigger technical solutions, and that's where the real tough stuff begins. I was probably burnt out for years, thinking it was just my own failings causing me to struggle so badly, and that isn't going to magically heal after a vacation and a few months at a lower-pressure job (mods???). It's going to be tough sledding for a bit, and I will be doubting my abilities and probably unecessarily stressed about all kinds of minor things, and I just hope that being in a better spot will help soften that.
 
#### I'm interested in writing again?
I got a lot of nice feedback about [my Blue Jays post](/2025/11/06/fanfare-for-these-uncommon-men/), thank you. (A good friend called it an "essay" which makes it sound so legitimate and polished! They're not wrong, I just hadn't expected such terminology for my sad blog posts.) 

I actually found the process of writing it incredibly frustrating. I used to write blog posts regularly, and I wrote about baseball off and on, but I stopped at some point. After that, all of my writing has mostly been for myself in journals, short-form thoughts on Twitter and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ruhee.ca), or in PR descriptions and Slack messages. Many of these involve excising all unnecessary words so that I can convey a concept as clearly and concisely as possible (either because of a word count limit or for business communication), which completely destroys any inklings of style. Now when I try to write anything it's flat, literal, lackluster. It's doing a job, but that job isn't "evoking feelings". 

Contrast this with [something I read recently](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/essay/in-defense-of-despair):

_[...]in my late teens and early twenties I felt, selfishly, that the worst parts of the world existed only in the small radius of my various heartbreaks. And, to the credit of those heartbreaks, some of them were worthy of that lie. What I love about the heart is that it’s capable of breaking in infinite ways; may we never live long enough to experience all of them, but may we live long enough to experience the ways the heart can repair itself for subsequent breakings. The cycle of rupture and repair is a requirement of living, a cost of surviving, something that goes hand in hand with another reality of survival: that, throughout your life, you may not only lose people but also gain them._

Now... yeah, I know. _I know._ I'm never going to be Hanif Abdurraqib, or even a fraction of him. But do you catch how that prose is crackling and moving and carrying you along in its current? It's really hard to do anything like that when you've been practicing the opposite (and, again, when you are not Hanif Abdurraqib, but stick with me).

I do blame some of this on the way social media, in particular, lets you skim the surface of everything, reacting and commenting but not really digging in. I am very susceptible to this as a short-form-textual-media enjoyer. I've seen so many _posts_ about something, but have I _read about_ and _formed opinions on_ and _engaged with_ that thing? Unlikely. In the end, it means most of my thoughts are also surface-level and not very complex. That comes out in the writing. 

I guess what I'm saying is I appreciate the craft in a way I haven't allowed myself to do for awhile, and I'm going to work harder on both thinking and writing about that thinking, just to build the muscles again.

### Things I liked recently

* [Horrible edge cases to consider when dealing with music](https://dustri.org/b/horrible-edge-cases-to-consider-when-dealing-with-music.html) (via [weird wide web hole](https://buttondown.com/weirdwidewebhole), a newsletter I've really been enjoying). This may as well be titled "[falsehoods programmers believe about names](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/), music edition". As both a musician and software engineer (and, for many years, meticulous-ID3-tag-data-maintainer), I couldn't get enough of this. (Don't miss the link to the [MusicBrainz db schema](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema)!!!) 
* [I Re-Read, Therefore I Understand](https://philosophynow.org/issues/94/I_Re-Read_Therefore_I_Understand): René Descartes' advice on reading, and comprehending, philosophical texts. It's great advice for reading anything.
* [The woman who wouldn't stop having children.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/magazine/marybeth-lewis-13-children-felony-charges.html)
* I'm late to the game, literally, but I've become obsessed with playing [Immaculate Grid, baseball edition](https://www.sports-reference.com/immaculate-grid/), lately. This kind of makes it sound like I'm good at it, but in fact, I am horrendous. I don't have the kind of recall that allows me to pick a guy who satisfies the requirements; instead I have to roll down my mental list of guys and for each one see if I can remember if he matches. ("Name a player who played for Milwaukee and Atlanta" is, for me, almost impossible. "Name a bunch of guys who played for Milwaukee and see if my mental picture includes them playing for Atlanta," and vice-versa, is about the only thing I can do; this is both algorithmically inefficient and generally ineffective. But I'm working on it.) It's just fun to have [Guy-Remembering](https://deadspin.com/lets-remember-some-guys-1990-baseball-guys-1824018124/) as a service. (Also, [some insider info on getting "sicko scores"](https://bsky.app/profile/adarowski.bsky.social/post/3m5txlaeec22y).)
