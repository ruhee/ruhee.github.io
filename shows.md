I'm currently a recurring guest with [Lowest of the Low](http://lowestofthelow.com/) and [Ron Hawkins & The Do Good Assassins](https://www.ronhawkins.com/music/type/do-good-assassins/).

Sometimes I play with [Cedarstrip Rocketship](https://cedarstriprocketship.bandcamp.com/) and [Shrinehouse](https://www.facebook.com/shrinehouseband/) (an Amy Winehouse tribute), and sometimes with other people too.
